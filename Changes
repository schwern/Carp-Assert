Revision history for Perl module Carp::Assert

0.22 2023-03-04
    - Removed shouldn't. As of perl 5.37.9 use of apostrophe
      as a package separator warns. As of 5.42 it will be removed.
      Really Schwern, you should have resisted the urge. :-)
    - Changed the Makefile.PL metadata to point at my repo, not
      the Schwern repo.
